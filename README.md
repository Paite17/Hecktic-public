# Hecktic-public
The public version of the repository for the game HECKTIC by MrLewisPaite, play it here: https://mrlewispaite.itch.io/hecktic
This version removes the original PUN App ID from the games files so that it cannot connect to the live game's servers.
If you want to be able to play online with your own version, you must make a new PUN 2 application on Photon's website, and then fill in the App ID

Please note that this repository is based on HECKTIC version 1.3.1
